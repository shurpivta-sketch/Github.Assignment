  <h1>Upcoming Super Mario Movie</h1>
  <p>This movie will have new characters such as Roselina, Burto, Bowser Jr., Yoshi and so many more. They also reference alot of things, like the T-rex from Mario Odyssey and some planets as well, and the movie will come out on April 1 in Kyiv and I am so excited to see it.</p>
